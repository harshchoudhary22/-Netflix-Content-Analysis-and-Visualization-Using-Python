# 📊 Netflix Content Analysis and Visualization Using Python

This project explores and visualizes global Netflix content trends using a real-world dataset from [Kaggle] Using Python libraries like **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**, I performed data cleaning, analysis, and created various visualizations to understand the distribution and evolution of Netflix content over time.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Netflix Titles Dataset - Kaggle]
- **File Used**: `netflix_titles.csv`

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Dropped rows with missing values in critical columns: `type`, `title`, `country`, `release_year`, `rating`, and `duration`.
- Converted data types where necessary (e.g., duration string to integer for movies).

## 📊 Visualizations

### 1. Movies vs TV Shows
A bar chart comparing the total number of Movies and TV Shows on Netflix.

### 2. Rating Distribution
A pie chart showing the proportion of different content ratings (TV-MA, PG-13, etc.).

### 3. Release Trends Over the Years
Line and scatter plots to display how the number of content releases has changed by year.

### 4. Movie Duration Distribution
Histogram of movie durations to understand the typical length of Netflix movies.

### 5. Top 10 Countries by Content
Horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 countries with the most Netflix titles.

### 6. Movies vs TV Shows Over Time
Subplot comparing the yearly trend of Movies vs TV Shows released.
